# Typing-Speed-Game
This Python-based Typing Speed Game is an interactive application designed to assess and improve typing speed and accuracy. The game provides a fun and engaging way for users to practice their typing skills while receiving real-time feedback.
# Tools Used:
1. Programming Language: Python
2. GUI Library: Tkinter (for graphical interface)
3. Randomization: random (for generating random words)
# How to Play:
When the game starts, a random word appears on the screen. The player has 60 seconds to type as many words as possible. Press Enter after typing each word to get a new one. The game tracks the number of words typed and accuracy in real time. A timer on the screen counts down from 60 seconds. 

After time runs out, a performance summary is displayed, including: 
1. Words typed correctly
2. Words typed incorrectly
3. Final score.

Based on the score, an emoji-based reaction appears:
1. Pro emoji for high scores (above 15).
2. Happy emoji for moderate scores (10-15).
3. Regretful emoji for low scores (below 10).

A prompt appears asking “Do you want to play again?”
1. Selecting “Yes” restarts the game.
2. Selecting “No” exits the game.
